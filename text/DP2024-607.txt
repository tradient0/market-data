securities be credited directly to the client account by the Clearing Corporations 
(CC).  
 
2. As prescribed in the aforementioned Circular, under Phase -1, the securities for 
pay-out in the equity cash segment (including netted cash and F&O Physical 
Settlement) shall be credited directly to the respective client’s demat account 
by the Clearing Corp orations.  
 
3. As a consequence of the above, the timing of the payout of securities shall be 
revised from 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM. Thus, as a result of Direct Payout, the 
securities shall be credited to the clients’ demat account on the same settlement  
day instead of one working day from the receipt of pay -out from the Clearing 
Corporation . 
  
4. The extant Activity Schedule for T+1 Rolling Settlement, under Para 1.4 of the 
Chapter 3 of the SEBI Master circular on Stock Exchanges and Clearing

pay-out of securities.
